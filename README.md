# My e-portfolio about Gatsby

Welcome to my e-Portfolio about Gatsby! This repository contains the source code for my e-portfolio exercise at DHBW Karlsruhe.

## Getting Started

To get started with my e-portfolio, all you need to do is clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BraeuerMax/Gatsby-EPortfolio.git
cd Gatsby-EPortfolio
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```sh
npm start
```
### or

```sh
gatsby develop
```

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:8000 where you can view and interact with the site.

# Tasks:
- Add a new page for blogs and expand it with a new blog post. (.../blogs/firstpost)
  - Implement the page in such a way that it uses the same layout and navbar as the pages that were previously implemented.
- Add a custom footer as a component to the layout. (Copyright can be kept or extended)
